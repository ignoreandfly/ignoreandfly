Hello, I am Siddhant, a final year undergrad majoring in Electrical and Electronics with a minor in Data Science at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. My interest lies in deep learning, computer vision, and image processing.

Previously, I interned at Spectrum Lab at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/), where I worked on adapting the [Segment Anything Model](https://segment-anything.com/)  for the task of optic disc and optic cup segmentation in fundus image. 

During my undergraduate, I conducted research on AI in Health Care, AI Security and the use of Deep Learning in battery health management. The bulk of the work was done under [Prof Harish Kumar J.R.](https://harish-jr.github.io/portfolio/index.html), and [Prof. Munesh Chandra Trivedi](https://nita.irins.org/profile/240539).

When I am not programming or doing mathematics, you will find me reading, watching sitcoms, scribbling in my journal, and more often than not posting hot takes on X (formerly known as Twitter).
