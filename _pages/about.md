Hello, I am Siddhant Bhardwaj, a final year undergrad majoring in Electrical and Electronics with a minor in Data Science at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. My interest lies in deep learning, computer vision, and image processing.

Previously, I interned at Spectrum Lab at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, where I worked on adapting the Segment Anything Model for the task of optic disc and optic cup segmentation in fundus image. 

During my undergraduate, I conducted research on AI in Health Care, AI Security and the use of Deep Learning in battery health management. The bulk of the work was done under Dr. Harish Kumar J.R., and Dr. Munesh Chandra Trivedi.

When I am not programming or doing mathematics, you will find me reading, watching sitcoms, scribbling in my journal and, more often than not posting hot takes on Twitter.
